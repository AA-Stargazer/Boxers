scrapped box fighters 


I can't show complete file because it's so big, but as an example it's enough.

Sometimes proboxer don't have amateur career info, or vice versa. You can see their id appear only once (all already in order in the file).
Or some rows are mostly empty except circuit/name/id, because these are not belongs to any fighter (like judge).

If the column is empty that belongs to any row, that means there isn't info about it in the webpage....
